## Image based Search

Image-based query search is an emerging technology that can revolutionize the e-commerce industry. Traditionally, e-commerce searches have relied on text-based queries, which can be time-consuming and may not accurately capture what the customer is looking for. Image-based search, on the other hand, allows customers to upload an image and find similar products based on visual features such as color, shape, and texture
