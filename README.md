## AR APP

Users can interact with, position, and observe the 3D model in the surroundings with the aid of ARcore and screenviewer.
Google's framework for creating augmented reality experiences is called ARCore. Your phone can perceive its surroundings, comprehend the outside world, and interact with information thanks to ARCore, which makes use of many APIs. To enable shared AR experiences, some APIs are accessible on iOS and Android.

## Image based Search

AÂ new technology that has the potential to completely transform the e-commerce sector is image-based query search. Text-based queries, which can be time-consuming and may not fully capture what the client is looking for, have traditionally been the mainstay of e-commerce searches. Contrarily, image-based search enables users to upload a picture and identify comparable goods based on visual cues like color, shape, and texture.
